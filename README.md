A web-based file locker that combines biometric face authentication with Fernet encryption to provide secure encryption and decryption of files — all through a simple and elegant interface.

## Features
- Face-based authentication** for decryption (no password required)
- Fernet symmetric encryption** ensures file confidentiality and integrity
- Local ZIP archive with encrypted file, face data, and secret key
- Smart biometric matching using Euclidean distance
- Face registration and live verification using webcam
- Fully local — no cloud storage or external APIs required

## Technologies Used

- **Flask** – A lightweight Python web framework used to build the backend server, handle routing, and manage HTTP requests.

- **OpenCV** – Handles webcam access and performs face detection using Haar cascades.

- **NumPy** – Used for numerical operations like face vector processing and similarity computation.

- **Cryptography** – Provides Fernet encryption and decryption to securely lock and unlock files.

- **HTML / CSS / JavaScript** – Powers the frontend of the application — the web interface users interact with.

- **Bootstrap 5** – Used for styling and responsive design to ensure the interface works across all devices.
